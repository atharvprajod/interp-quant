# LLaMA Circuit-Aware Quantization

## Overview

This repository implements a specialized codebase for circuit-aware quantization of **LLaMA-3.1-8B** using interpretability-guided mixed precision. By leveraging mechanistic interpretability methods, the pipeline identifies and preserves critical neurons and attention heads (circuits) while quantizing less important parts of the model. The result is a model that strikes a balance between memory efficiency, performance, and throughput on modern GPUs.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Circuit-Aware Quantization
- **Circuit Awareness**: Analyzes the internal network circuits to identify critical neurons and attention heads that are essential to maintain model performance.
- **Mixed Precision**: Maintains the most important computation paths in high precision (FP16) while quantizing the rest to a lower precision (e.g., 4-bit via BitsAndBytes).

### 2. Interpretability-Guided Calibration
- **Layer Integrated Gradients**: Utilizes the Captum library to compute per-layer importance scores that highlight crucial features that drive model outputs.  
  (See [core/importance_scorer.py](core/importance_scorer.py) for details.)
- **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Uses ablation studies (e.g., in [core/circuit_tracer.py](core/circuit_tracer.py)) to determine the relative importance of attention heads.

### 3. Quantization Pipeline
- **Custom Mixed-Precision Layers**: Implements quantized linear layers (e.g., `CircuitAwareLinear` in [core/quant_layers.py](core/quant_layers.py)) that split the computations between an FP16 branch and a quantized branch.
- **Dynamic Head Preservation**: Dynamically selects which attention heads to preserve in high precision during inference, enhancing performance on tasks that demand complex reasoning.

### 4. Advanced Optimization Strategies
- **Gradient-Based Importance Updates**: An approach (demonstrated in the `AdaptiveCircuitQuant` class) for updating importance scores during fine-tuning.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: All model-specific quantization thresholds and settings are defined in YAML configuration files (see [configs/llama3-8b.yaml](configs/llama3-8b.yaml)).
